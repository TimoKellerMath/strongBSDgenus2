# Computation of p-adic L-functions for ordinary primes for newforms of weight 2, trivial nebentypus

__Note:__ in periods.m, you have to adapt your Magma directory!

## Usage

load "computeLpfT.m";

## External code used
* Raymond van Bommel's code for the real period and Tamagawa numbers (see the ancillary files at https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04667)

## Based on
* Darmon--Pollack's code for the p-adic L-function from https://www.math.mcgill.ca/darmon/programs/shp/shp.html, generalizing it from coefficient ring Z to rings of integers and specializing to weight k = 2
